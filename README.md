# Redis Remake in C/C++

This project is a [Redis](https://redis.io/)-inspired K/V store - an in-memory database, implemented in C/C++. This repo documents my learning journey of low-level systems programming and network server development. It is structured in stages, and each stage is an extension of the previous one.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to understand how a high-performance server with non-blocking IO works.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into several stages, each stage builds upon the previous one, introducing new features. The final goal is to have a simple in-memory key-value store server, capable of serving multiple clients concurrently using non-blocking I/O.

### [Stage 1: Simple Client-Server](./01_simple_client-server/)

A basic, iterative TCP server and a client that can exchange single messages.

**Concepts:** Basic socket API (`socket`, `bind`, `listen`, `accept`), blocking I/O, simple request-response loop.


### [Stage 2: Basic Protocol & Connection Reuse](./02_basic_protocol_single_TCP/)

The client and server are improved to handle multiple requests over a single, persistent TCP connection. A simple length-prefixed protocol is introduced to frame messages and handle partial reads/writes.

**Concepts:** Persistent connections, message framing, I/O wrappers (`read_n`, `write_n`).

### [Stage 3: Event-Based Concurrency](./03_event-based_concurrency/)

The server is rewritten in C++ to be fully concurrent without using threads. It uses non-blocking I/O and the `poll()` system call to handle many clients in a single event loop.

**Concepts:** Event-driven architecture, non-blocking I/O, readiness notification API (with `poll()`).

## Build & Run
Requirements:
- Linux
- A C/C++ compiler (`gcc`, `g++`)
- `make` build system

1. Clone and open the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone 
   cd redisRemake
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired stage, e.g., `01_simple_client-server` and build it:
   ```bash
   cd 01_simple_client-server
   make
   ```
3. Run the server in one terminal:
    ```bash
    ./server
    ```
4. In another terminal, run the client:
    ```bash
    ./client
    ``` 
# todos:
- [ ] switch to `epoll()`
